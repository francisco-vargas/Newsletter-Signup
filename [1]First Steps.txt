Here we are going go set a newsletter who save users data in real time. For this we'll need an API who save the mail data in the cloud, we are using mail chimp for this.

1- First go to mailchimp.com, if you're new, then create an account.
2- You need two data numbers to start working, an API key and an Audience List Id.
    - API key is found clicking in your profile name > Account, then look for Extras drop menu > API keys (copy this number and save it on a notepad)
    - Audience List Id, this one is tricky, because for the first time there will be no audience. For the first time, in left menu select Contacts > All contacts. If you have just created your account, there should be only your user account. Select Settings drop menu > Audience name and defaults. Check Audiennce ID section, copy that number and save it on a notepad. Once your audience is created and filled with other emails, the "Contacts" menu turned into "Audience".

3- This is the actual endpoint you will need in order to post to your list -
After create an account in Mailchimp, here are the credentials you need to use:

    const url = " https://<dc>.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/<YOUR LIST ID>";

    <dc> stands for data center, and you should get that from the last few characters in your api key. 
    Eg: Your API Key : b54xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxa1e65d274c9-us13 | <dc> = us13.

    const options = {
        method: "POST",
        auth: "ANYTHING-HERE:b54xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxa1e65dxxxc9-us13"
    }
